# SQL-PowerBI_AWproject

Hello there,
Welcome to Jung's Github! :)

In this project, I assumed that I have received a business request and raw data from the client, AdventureWorks. 
I first classified it into main needs of the company which are Sales, Customers, and Products in order to meet the requests surely. 
I cleaned, processed, and analyzed the raw data Using SSMS, then created dashboards to visualize it with relevant graphs, charts and features using Power BI.
As the business requested, the reports mainly focus on the revenue in comparison with the budget of 2018, 2019 and 2020. 

There are two types of data, one is exported raw CSV type data. The other one is the cleaned and processed SQL type data.
You can explore all the analysis that are visualized through dashboard. 

Hope you enjoy it!
